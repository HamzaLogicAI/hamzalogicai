## Hey there! I'm [Hamza Kaleem](https://hamzalogicai.netlify.app/) 👋

### 💡 What I'm all about
I'm a Data Scientist and a Machine Learning Engineer, specializing in training and fine-tuning ML algorithms to optimize your data's potential. These models give you the ease of making their decisions on their own, saving you time and money. With a keen eye for data analytics and visualization, I excel at extracting actionable insights from complex datasets. My approach ensures that my models are highly functional, visually appealing, user-friendly, and easy to implement.

With a growth mindset, I'm a strong advocate of self-education. I'm always trying to learn more about what interests me most.

### 🌱 Currently exploring
- The deeper realms of Machine Learning with Data Pre-Processing and Data Modeling.
- Learning the [Machine Learning Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEZHFA3qgB8&list=PLfP3JxW-T70Fg3SKdwcjtRTzUcyg9N5-k)

### 🛠️ My toolbox
```Python
const mySkills = {
  languages: ['Python', 'HTML', 'CSS'],
  tools: ['Jupyter Notebook', 'Colab' 'Github', 'Spyder']
};
```

### 🚀 What's next?
I'm always looking for exciting projects and awesome people to collaborate with. Whether you're dreaming up the next big ml application or need to spruce up an existing one, I'm here to help make it happen!
